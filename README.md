  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
Husky Bot harnesses the power of MongoDB, to ensure smooth management and operation across multiple servers. Each time Husky joins a new Discord server, it cleverly creates a unique database entry. This means every server gets its own dedicated space for bot configurations and data, allowing for highly personalized settings.

This feature is designed to keep you well-informed about the bot's presence across different servers, ensuring effective monitoring and management of its activities.

## Installation
<details>
<summary>Installation Steps:</summary>
<br>
Follow these steps to install and set up Husky:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store your bot's code. Then, run the following command to clone the bot's repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Laernos/Husky.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Bot's Directory:**
   ```
   cd Husky
   ```

3. **Install Python and Dependencies:**
   
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website. Next, create a virtual environment and activate it (recommended for isolation):
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. **Invite the Bot to Your Discord Server:**

   - Create a Discord bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

   - Copy your bot's token.

   - Use the provided invite link template or generate an OAuth2 invite link with the "bot" scope and the necessary permissions. Invite the bot to your server.
  

5. **MongoDB SETUP**
   
   Husky uses MongoDB for data storage. If you don't have a MongoDB account, follow these steps to create one:
    Create a MongoDB Atlas Account:
    
    - **Visit MongoDB Atlas:**
       
        Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
   
   - **Create a Cluster:**
    
        Once logged in, create a new cluster by following the provided instructions.
        Select a cloud provider and region that best suits your needs.
     
    - **Set Up Database User:**
    
        In your MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the "Database Access" section.
        Click "Add New Database User" and create a username and password. Remember these credentials.
   
    - **Whitelist Your IP Address:**
    
        In the "Network Access" section, click "Add IP Address" and whitelist your current IP address.
      
    - **Get Connection String:**
    
        In your cluster's dashboard, click "Connect" and choose "Connect Your Application."
      
        Copy the connection string and replace <password> with the database user's password.
      
        Example connection string:
        ```
        mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        ```

      
5. **Configure the bot**
   
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Husky bot project and fill it with the following variables:
   ```env
    DISCORD_API_TOKEN= "YOUR_DISCORD_API_TOKEN_HERE"
    GUILD = "YOUR_GUILD_NAME"
    GUILD_INVITE = "YOUR_GUILD_INVITE_LINK"
    MONGO_TOKEN= "YOUR_MONGO_DB_TOKEN"
    API_KEY= 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    OWNER_ID = "YOUR_OWNER_USER_ID"
    STATUS_PAGE = 'https://huskybot1.statuspage.io/'
    BOT_INVITE_LINK = 'YOUR_BOT_INVITE_LINK'
    BUG_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID = 'YOUR_BUG_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID'
    BOT_STATUS_CHANNEL_ID = "YOUR_STATUS_CHANNEL_ID"
